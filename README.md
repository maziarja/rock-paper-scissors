## Overview

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where you can play against the computer. I didn’t focus on styling or implement any animations because I’m currently focusing on improving my React skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to trigger a refresh in React and use useRef to create a condition that prevents useEffect from running more than once.

### Continued development

Since I’m focusing on React, I didn’t spend time on styling, so I haven’t implemented animations or refined the design.
